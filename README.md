# buildozer-builder

This is an auto-built copy of [Buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer).

The maintainers of buildozer don't have an auto-build buildozer container, so
this repo is designed to periodically check out the source and try building it.
Upon success, it'll update the Docker container at `johnstrunk/buildozer`.
